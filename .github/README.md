If you run into "database is locked" error, it means the database is being accessed by multiple connections (i.e the previous python process is still trying to access the database even though you tried to kill it with CTRL + Z).  SQLite database is locked until that transaction is committed.

To fix, run the following command in the terminal:

sudo pkill -9 python3

Once done, start the bot again with

bash start
